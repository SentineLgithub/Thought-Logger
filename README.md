## How to Use?

After finishing the installation process, you must launch the app. And you'll be greeted with this.

![interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68242099/137069866-9de85060-c0cf-4907-9e3d-3931f614e35f.png)

This is the interface. Type your feelings into the bar and then press `Enter` to log the text into **Profile 1** or press `Shift+Enter` to log the text into **Profile 2**.

Clicking the `See Log` button will open the last edited log file i.e. in which you have last entered. 

**Tip:** Press `escape` key to close the window quickly.

### Deleting a profile:
Clicking on the `Delete Log` button will open this dialog, in which you can choose to delete any of the two profiles.

## Customising your logger

Ok this might be a little hard for the dum-dums, but you can do it.

So, head over to your My Documents folder and find the 'Thought Logger' folder. There, you will find the **ThoughtLogger.ini** file.
Click it and you'll find something like this-

![inifile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68242099/135040471-4d9fd50b-72d3-4696-baac-9490145b5b62.png ".ini file")

### To change the custom text:
Change the `customtext` value to the text you'd like to appear. Remember, there is a limit of **22 characters**.

### To change the background color:
Change the `backgroundcolor` value to the hex code of the color you'd like to appear. For example `#000000` is for black.

### To change the background color:
Change the `fontcolor` value to the hex code of the color you'd like to appear. For example `#fff` is for white.

## AutoHotkey integration

You can use [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to open your ThoughtLogger application with just a shortcut. Just get the **Run ThoughtLogger.ahk** file from the files and run the script.

By default, the shortcut is set to `Ctrl+Alt+T`. You can change it with yourself. Just go throught their [Documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Program.htm)
Note: AutoHotkey is needed to be installed for this.
