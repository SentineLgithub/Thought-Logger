## Customising your logger

Ok this might be a little hard for the dum-dums, but you can do it.

So, head over to your My Documents folder and find the 'Thought Logger' folder. There, you will find the **ThoughtLogger.ini** file.
Click it and you'll find something like this-

#### To change the custom text:
Change the `customtext` value to the text you'd like to appear. Remember, there is a limit of 22 characters.

#### To change the background color:
Change the `backgroundcolor` value to the hex code of the color you'd like to appear. For example `#000000` is for black.

#### To change the background color:
